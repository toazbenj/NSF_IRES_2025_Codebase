    # Lookahead is computed using the following: lookahead = min(max(min_lookahead, max_lookahead * curr_velocity / lookahead_ratio), max_lookahead);
    # min_lookahead: 0.5
    # max_lookahead: 3.0 # lookahead when the car is going around max velocity
    # lookahead_ratio: 8.0 # approximately the max velocity
